## Overview

Astro Linksplash is a splashpage templte build on Astro 4, which can be used as a template to create your own linktree-styled landing page.

## Installation

To install the template, either fork or clone the repo. With Astro, you need only run two packages to get started.

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Adding Content

Being an Astro template, you have free reign to change whatever code you want. However, this template was built around only needing to update a single file.
`/src/content.ts` contains a variety of global variables that you can edit for all content and images on the site.
